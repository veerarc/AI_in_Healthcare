*1.2 Identify Pain Points*: Each stage presents unique challenges:

- **High Costs**: Traditional drug development can cost over $1 billion per drug.

- **Extended Timelines**: The process often spans over a decade.

- **Low Success Rates**: Only a small fraction of drug candidates achieve approval.

# 2. AI Use Cases

*2.1 Define Problem Statements*: Specific challenges where AI can be impactful include:

- **Predicting Molecular Interactions**: Understanding how compounds interact with biological targets.

- **Patient Response Prediction**: Anticipating individual reactions to therapies.
- - **Target Identification and Validation**: AI algorithms analyze extensive biological data to identify potential drug targets, such as proteins or genes associated with diseases. By predicting the relevance of these targets, AI aids in prioritizing them for further investigation.

- **Biomarker Discovery**: AI analyzes complex datasets to identify biomarkers that can predict disease progression or treatment response, facilitating patient stratification and personalized medicine approaches.

- **GenAI in Drug Design**: Generative AI models create novel molecular structures with desired properties from scratch. This approach accelerates the identification of promising drug candidates by exploring vast chemical spaces efficiently.

- **Virtual Screening**: Machine learning models predict the binding affinity between small molecules and target proteins, enabling the rapid screening of large compound libraries to identify potential hits for experimental validation.

- **Optimization of Lead Compounds**: AI-driven optimization fine-tunes the chemical structures of lead compounds to enhance their efficacy, selectivity, and pharmacokinetic properties, streamlining the lead optimization phase.


- **Predictive Modeling for ADMET**: AI predicts Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, Excretion, and Toxicity (ADMET) properties of compounds, assisting in the early identification of potential drug failures and reducing late-stage attrition rates.

- **Drug Repurposing**: By analyzing existing drugs and their mechanisms, AI identifies new therapeutic uses for approved or shelved drugs, potentially reducing development time and costs.


- **Clinical Trials**: AI optimizes clinical trial protocols by identifying suitable patient populations, predicting outcomes, and enhancing recruitment strategies, thereby increasing the likelihood of trial success.

*2.2 Business Value*: Potential benefits encompass:

- **Reduced Time-to-Market**: AI can accelerate drug discovery processes.

- **Cost Savings**: AI-driven efficiencies can significantly lower development expenses.
